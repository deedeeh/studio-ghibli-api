# Studio Ghibli API 

This repo is created to mock API calls using Mock Service Worker library. 

In `App.tsx` there is a button to load movie and when you click it the first movie title from [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) will be displayed on screen and the button will be hidden.

In `App.test.tsx` I mocked the API response with the expected movie title to check if the movie loads and displays on screen.
